## The most beautiful game

### Future stuff

- 📜 Instructions
- 🎷 Game music
- 📱 Mobile responsiveness
- 💻 Support screen resizing (map dimensions recalculation)
- ~~🌍 Favicon~~
- ~~📈 Improve scoring (right now almost impossible to get over 85)~~
- ~~📍 Better turn result screen (display distance and time)~~
- ~~🗺 Summary and detailed results at the end of game (display all attempts on map)~~
- ~~👾 Make 'Normal' mode always display a few easy, a few medium, and a few hard cities~~
- ~~📖 Pre-select cities to play at the begining of the game. This should improve performance and pave the way for peer-to-peer battles (Note: need to think about how to prevent people from cheating here if they inspect the state/code.)~~
- ~~🙈 Score to pop up from line~~
- ~~🏏 Scoreboard displayed in 3 columns sorted by difficulty~~
- 👨‍💻 General TD and code clean-up
- 🐛 Unit tests

#### Potential 'microservices'

- 🗺 Cities service (city database and selection)
- 🤺 Battle service (make real-time peer-to-peer battles possible)
- 🏆 Score service (calculate turn scores and maintain list of global top scores)
- 📊 Analytics service (i.e. save average error distance per city, to select cities based on real user behaviour rather than arbitrary lists)
